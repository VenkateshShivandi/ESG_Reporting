# Template Assistant Repository (Template)

## Introduction

This is a template repository to build assistants/agents for future projects. This repository includes all the requirements for smooth initiation and testing of future projects, featuring an automated CI/CD system with GitHub Releases and Actions.

## Workflow and Testing

This is our proposed workflow for future assistant projects.

### **1. Feature Branches (`feature/**`)**

**Purpose**: Development of new features.

- **Testing at This Stage**:
  - **Unit Tests**: Ensure individual components or functions work as expected.
  - **Static Code Analysis**: Run linters and formatters to maintain code quality.
  - **Component/Integration Tests**: Test how newly developed components work together.

- **Trigger**: Automatically when a developer pushes changes to `feature/**`.

---

### **2. Build Stage (`build`)**

**Purpose**: Verify that the codebase can be built successfully.

- **Testing at This Stage**:
  - **Build Verification**: Ensure the project compiles without errors.
  - **Smoke Tests**: Perform a lightweight run to confirm that the application starts and core functionality is intact.
  - **Automated Tests**: Execute the entire test suite, including:
    - Unit Tests
    - Integration Tests
    - Regression Tests

- **Trigger**: Automatically after a pull request (PR) is created or updated.

---

### **3. Release Branches (`release/*`)**

**Purpose**: Prepare the code for production.

- **Testing at This Stage**:
  - **Acceptance Testing**: Validate that features meet requirements (done manually or automated).
  - **Performance Testing**: Assess performance metrics like response time and scalability.
  - **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**: Test workflows that simulate user behavior in a staging environment.
  - **Security Testing**: Identify vulnerabilities or security risks.

- **Trigger**: Before merging into `main`.

---

### **4. Main Branch (`main`)**

**Purpose**: Represents the stable, production-ready code.

- **Testing at This Stage**:
  - **Post-Deployment Verification**:
    - Smoke Tests
    - Synthetic Monitoring
    - Real-User Monitoring
  - **Canary Testing** (Optional): Gradually roll out the release to a subset of users and monitor.
  - **Performance and Load Testing**: Ensure the system can handle real-world traffic.

- **Trigger**: Automatically upon deployment to production.

---

### **5. Hotfix Branches (`hotfix/*`)**

**Purpose**: Address urgent issues in production.

- **Testing at This Stage**:
  - **Unit Tests**: Validate changes in isolation.
  - **Regression Testing**: Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality.
  - **Targeted Functional Tests**: Focus on the areas directly affected by the hotfix.
  - **Quick Acceptance Testing**: Verify the issue is resolved without introducing new problems.

- **Trigger**: Immediately after pushing a hotfix and before merging back to `release/*`.

### **Workflow Testing Summary**

| **Branch**   | **Testing Types**                               | **Environment**        | **Trigger**               |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `feature/**` | Unit, Static Code Analysis, Integration Tests   | Local/Dev Environment  | Push to `feature/**`      |
| `build`      | Build Verification, Smoke, Automated Tests      | CI/CD Pipeline         | PR creation/update        |
| `release/*`  | Acceptance, E2E, Performance, Security Tests    | Staging Environment    | Pre-merge into `main`     |
| `main`       | Post-Deployment, Monitoring, Canary, Load Tests | Production Environment | Deployment to production  |
| `hotfix/*`   | Unit, Regression, Functional, Quick Acceptance  | Staging Environment    | Hotfix push and pre-merge |

---

### Additional Recommendations:

- **Test Automation**: Automate as much as possible using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.
- **Code Coverage**: Use tools like SonarQube to monitor and enforce code coverage standards.
- **Rollback Strategy**: Ensure you have the ability to revert changes in case of failures.
- **Parallel Testing**: Run tests in parallel to speed up the CI/CD pipeline.
