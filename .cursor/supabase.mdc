# Supabase Integration Rules

## Description
This rule ensures that the AI follows Supabase's authentication and data handling conventions, especially for row-level security (RLS) and interactions with Supabase storage.

## Behavior
- **Authentication**:
  - Ensure that users are authenticated via Google OAuth.
  - Only allow access to ESG data if the user’s `organization_id` matches the data’s `organization_id`.
- **Row-Level Security**:
  - Enforce the rule `CREATE POLICY "ESG Data Access" ON esg_metrics USING (organization_id = auth.uid()::text);` for querying data.
- **Storage**:
  - Ensure proper file storage in Supabase storage buckets (e.g., `raw/` and `processed/`).
  - Process files based on their type (PDF, Excel, CSV, etc.) for correct handling.

## Examples
```ts
const { user } = useUser();
if (!user) redirect('/auth');
